# Dev

This is the main way of running services locally. You can run it with `docker-compose up -d`.

## Configuration

You will need to configue a local `.env` file according to the `.env.template` file.

## Setup

You need to run `git submodule --init --recursive` first and then follow the instructions in the `README.md` file for each of the submodules.
